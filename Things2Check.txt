Here are some issues that need to be fixed: 
- When last inspection is marked as passed failed once is marked as No but sometimes it is not legit because
the inspection passed has been set automatically because the permit status is finalied and there are no inspections.(see Tulare)
- Standarize permit status (df = utils.assign_permit_status(df)). That it because.. it needs the permit status to be assigned but.. 
when you do it after assigning the permit status, it assigns No to everything.. I need to do it before.
- The inspections are sometimes not properly geting in the right order due to the format of the date, standarize (within the Merge_Inspections function) before anything! 
- Problems with Merge_Inspections. It gets rid of the inspections when the last_inspections_columns function is previously assigned. 
- When recovering the last inspoections, the note from a previous inspection shows up when last inspection does not have a not, fix this.
